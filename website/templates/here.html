            <h3>1.Control Your Portion Size</h3>
            <p>
              How much you eat is just as important as what you eat. Overloading
              your plate, taking seconds and eating until you feel stuffed can
              lead to eating more calories than you should. Portions served in
              restaurants are often more than anyone needs. Following a few
              simple tips to control food portion size can help you shape up
              your diet as well as your heart and waistline: Use a small plate
              or bowl to help control your portions. Eat more low-calorie,
              nutrient-rich foods, such as fruits and vegetables Eat smaller
              amounts of high-calorie, high-sodium foods, such as refined,
              processed or fast foods. It's also important to keep track of the
              number of servings you eat. Some things to keep in mind: A serving
              size is a specific amount of food, defined by common measurements
              such as cups, ounces or pieces. For example, one serving of pasta
              is about 1/3 to 1/2 cup, or about the size of a hockey puck. A
              serving of meat, fish or chicken is about 2 to 3 ounces, or about
              the size and thickness of a deck of cards. The recommended number
              of servings per food group may vary depending on the specific diet
              or guidelines you're following. Judging serving size is a learned
              skill. You may need to use measuring cups and spoons or a scale
              until you're comfortable with your judgment.

            <h3>2.Eat More Vegetables and Fruits</h3>
            <p>
              Vegetables and fruits are good sources of vitamins and minerals.
              Vegetables and fruits are also low in calories and rich in dietary
              fiber. Vegetables and fruits, like other plants or plant-based
              foods, contain substances that may help prevent cardiovascular
              disease. Eating more fruits and vegetables may help you cut back
              on higher calorie foods, such as meat, cheese and snack foods.
              Featuring vegetables and fruits in your diet can be easy. Keep
              vegetables washed and cut in your refrigerator for quick snacks.
              Keep fruit in a bowl in your kitchen so that you'll remember to
              eat it. Choose recipes that have vegetables or fruits as the main
              ingredients, such as vegetable stir-fry or fresh fruit mixed into
              salads.

              Whole grains are good sources of fiber and other nutrients that
              play a role in regulating blood pressure and heart health. You can
              increase the amount of whole grains in a heart-healthy diet by
              making simple substitutions for refined grain products. Or be
              adventuresome and try a new whole grain, such as whole-grain
              farro, quinoa or barley.

            <p>
              Limiting how much saturated and trans fats you eat is an important
              step to reduce your blood cholesterol and lower your risk of
              coronary artery disease. A high blood cholesterol level can lead
              to a buildup of plaques in the arteries, called atherosclerosis,
              which can increase the risk of heart attack and stroke.

            <h3>5. Choose low-fat protein sources</h3>
            <p>
              Lean meat, poultry and fish, low-fat dairy products, and eggs are
              some of the best sources of protein. Choose lower fat options,
              such as skinless chicken breasts rather than fried chicken patties
              and skim milk rather than whole milk. Fish is a good alternative
              to high-fat meats. Certain types of fish are rich in omega-3 fatty
              acids, which can lower blood fats called triglycerides. You'll
              find the highest amounts of omega-3 fatty acids in cold-water
              fish, such as salmon, mackerel and herring. Other sources are
              flaxseed, walnuts, soybeans and canola oil. Legumes — beans, peas
              and lentils — also are good, low-fat sources of protein and
              contain no cholesterol, making them good substitutes for meat.
              Substituting plant protein for animal protein — for example, a soy
              or bean burger for a hamburger — will reduce fat and cholesterol
              intake and increase fiber intake.

            <h3>6. Limit or reduce salt (sodium)</h3>
            <p>
              Eating too much salt can lead to high blood pressure, a risk
              factor for heart disease. Limiting salt (sodium) is an important
              part of a heart-healthy diet. The American Heart Association
              recommends that: Healthy adults have no more than 2,300 milligrams
              (mg) of sodium a day (about a teaspoon of salt) Most adults
              ideally have no more than 1,500 mg of sodium a day Although
              reducing the amount of salt you add to food at the table or while
              cooking is a good first step, much of the salt you eat comes from
              canned or processed foods, such as soups, baked goods and frozen
              dinners. Eating fresh foods and making your own soups and stews
              can reduce the amount of salt you eat. If you like the convenience
              of canned soups and prepared meals, look for ones with no added
              salt or reduced sodium. Be wary of foods that claim to be lower in
              sodium because they are seasoned with sea salt instead of regular
              table salt — sea salt has the same nutritional value as regular
              salt. Another way to reduce the amount of salt you eat is to
              choose your condiments carefully. Many condiments are available in
              reduced-sodium versions. Salt substitutes can add flavor to your
              food with less sodium.

            <h3>7. Plan ahead: Create daily menus</h3>
            <p>
              Create daily menus using the six strategies listed above. When
              selecting foods for each meal and snack, emphasize vegetables,
              fruits and whole grains. Choose lean protein sources and healthy
              fats, and limit salty foods. Watch your portion sizes and add
              variety to your menu choices. For example, if you have grilled
              salmon one evening, try a black bean burger the next night. This
              helps ensure that you'll get all of the nutrients the body needs.
              Variety also makes meals and snacks more interesting.
